**The feed mix moved into an outline you can edit: urlExtraFeedsOpml.** The interleaved feeds have lived in `extraFeeds` in config.json since the feature landed -- which means the one file on the server you can't casually touch, plus a restart, every time you want to add a magazine. Upstream's new Scripts menu pointed at the better way: put the list in an OPML file on the web and re-read it. Now one config setting, `urlExtraFeedsOpml`, names an outline whose feeds extend `extraFeeds`, and the server re-reads it on every poll cycle -- edit the outline, and within five minutes the new feed is in the timeline and on the checkbox rail, no restart anywhere. Feeds that survive an edit keep their poll state, so nothing re-announces; a feed named in both places counts once. The outline speaks subscription-list OPML: a node with an `xmlUrl` is a feed, a node with children is a group, same rendering as before. And the server can host its own outline -- drop it at `data/extrafeeds.opml` and it's served at `/extrafeeds.opml`, read fresh per request. perstitio.us runs this way now: its whole mix lives in [the outline](https://perstitio.us/extrafeeds.opml), which gained a *mal's sites* group as its first edit. Settings documented in [config.md](../docs/config.md), the endpoint in [api.md](../docs/api.md). This also merged upstream v0.6.12, with both of its security fixes -- see the entries below.

#### 8/2/26; 12:40 PM ET by CC

**Fixed a bug in feeds we generate.** We were using the wrong value from config.json to build the URL for the `<link>` element in RSS.chat-generated feeds. Fixed in server v0.6.12, on both public servers. Thanks to [iheartrss.com](https://iheartrss.com/), whose checker caught the mistake.

**Updating a server you already run.** Get the new `rssnetwork.js` and `package.json` from the repo and restart. No new packages this time, so there's no `npm install` step.

**Security fix in v0.6.11 -- please update.** A user contacted us about a potential security issue. We responded quickly and with v0.6.11 the issue is removed. If you're running rssnetwork.js on a publicly visible server, please install the new version now. Thanks!

**The server will read a file over the web for you: /readhttpfile.** A browser page can only fetch from its own server unless the far server opts in, and most don't. That was the wall in front of the Scripts menu (the client-side story -- see the client worknotes): the menu is an OPML file that can live anywhere, and the app couldn't read it. Now there's a general door: `/readhttpfile?url=...` reads the address and answers with the text in a `filetext` member, so the next feature that needs to read a file over the web won't have to solve this again. The new config setting for the menus, `urlMenuOpml`, goes to the client with the rest of the settings; leave it out and nothing changes. (Server v0.6.10, both public servers.)

**That error message at startup is gone.** Every time the server started, it printed `webSocketStartup: theWsServer.listen is not a function` -- alarming to read, especially on a new install, and entirely misleading: websockets were working the whole time. It's fixed, and the startup log is quiet now. To get it, update daveappserver: run `npm install` in your server's folder and restart.

**And reallysimple, the feed reader FeedLand and other apps are built on, now understands rss.chat conversations.** Until today it read our feeds but quietly discarded the two pieces that make a conversation a conversation -- which post a reply is replying to, and where a post's replies live. So an app reading rss.chat through it saw a flat list of posts and no threads, with nothing to indicate anything was missing. Fixed and published. Anything built on reallysimple gets threading by updating the package.

**Getting into your own server no longer waits on email.** Sign-in is a magic link, so until a new server can send mail, nobody can get in -- including the person who just installed it. That's a discouraging place to be stopped, and it's exactly where John Johnston found himself after putting rss.chat on his Mac: his mail provider wanted a verified sender identity before it would send anything, and in the meantime his own server wouldn't let him in. He got past it by reading the confirmation code out of the terminal log and typing the sign-in link himself. As of server v0.6.8, that trick is a feature. On the machine the server is running on, open `http://localhost:1420/localnewuser?screenname=yourname&email=you@example.com` and the browser lands on your home page, signed in as that name, ready to post -- no mail sent, nothing configured first. It works only from that machine: a request from anywhere else is refused, including one forwarded by a proxy like Caddy, nginx or PagePark sitting in front of your server, because the endpoint creates an account without checking that you own the address. So it's a way to look around your own install while you sort out email -- which you still need before anyone else can sign in. Written up in [email.md](../docs/email.md). Thanks to John, whose report is what got this built. (Both public servers.)

**Replying through the API works with either field name.** When you read a reply, the field pointing at its parent is called `inReplyToNum`. When you post one, the API expected `inReplyTo` -- and if you sent the other name, your reply was accepted but landed unthreaded, with no error. The first developer to build on the API did exactly that, reasonably. As of server v0.6.7 the server takes either name, so a reply threads no matter which one you send. (Both public servers.)

#### 7/27/26; 1:30 PM ET by CC

**Posting through the API got simpler: send markdown or HTML, whichever you have.** Until today the API expected HTML -- send only markdown and your post came out empty, which is exactly what happened to the first person who tried. Fixed, as of server v0.6.6 on both public servers: a markdown post and an HTML post come out looking the same, and a post with no text at all is refused with a plain sentence saying why. Edits work the same way.

**And the API docs were rewritten to earn that story.** The [newpost entry](https://github.com/scripting/rss.chat/blob/main/server/docs/api.md) now opens with the smallest call that works -- one field of markdown -- followed by a complete call you can copy, the actual response it produces, and what an error looks like. Getting your credentials no longer requires reverse-engineering: sign in to rss.chat in your browser, open the console, and the authentication section shows you exactly where your two values are. And there's a new page about the approach itself: [How we document APIs](https://github.com/scripting/rss.chat/blob/main/server/docs/howWeDocApis.md) -- a living document on writing docs for the reader, examples first, nothing but the truth. If you're documenting your own service, take whatever's useful. Thanks to jimr, whose report on demo.rss.chat started all of this.

**Updating a server you already run.** Get the new `rssnetwork.js` and `package.json` from the repo, run `npm install` (one new package, the markdown renderer), and restart.

#### 7/25/26; 6:17 PM ET by CC

**Every user has a feed from the moment they sign up.** It was reported that until someone posted for the first time, their feed address answered with a 404 -- which looked broken to anyone who subscribed to the whole community from the subscription list. Wrong, and now fixed two ways: when a new account is created, the server publishes the feed immediately -- a valid RSS feed with the user's name and no items yet -- and at startup the server checks every user and quietly publishes a feed for anyone missing one, so everyone who signed up before this change is covered too. A user is a feed, from day one. (Server v0.6.5.)

**And every server can now back itself up, nightly.** One line in config.json turns it on: `"flNightlyBackup": true`. Every night the server writes its whole database -- users, posts, likes, files, media -- to one dated JSON file in `data/backups/`, using the same export format that carried both public servers through the SQLite migration, restorable onto a fresh server with the import verb. Nothing to install, no cron, no scripts: the server does it itself, the way it should be. It's off by default; flip the flag and restart.

**Updating a server you already run.** Get the new `rssnetwork.js` and `package.json` from the repo and restart. On the first restart you'll see a log line for each user whose feed gets backfilled, then it's quiet. Add `"flNightlyBackup": true` to config.json if you want the nightly backup.

#### 7/25/26; 11:15 AM ET by CC

**A whole conversation in one call: /getthread.** Every conversation on rss.chat has always been walkable through the feeds -- each post's item points at a comments feed, each reply can point at its own, and the [threadwalker](https://github.com/scripting/rss.chat/tree/main/examples/threadwalker) example assembles a thread that way, one fetch per post, no API needed. Now there's a second door: call `/getthread` with a post's guid (or id) and the server answers with the post's item record plus a `replies` array -- each reply the same shape, nested all the way down. You get the post you ask about and everything under it; ask about the root and you get the whole thread. It's one call instead of many, it's less work for the server than serving the walk, and it's the same tree either way. No authentication -- it's an open read, like all the reads. Documented in [api.md](https://github.com/scripting/rss.chat/blob/main/server/docs/api.md), with a new example app, [getthread](https://github.com/scripting/rss.chat/tree/main/examples/getthread), that prints a conversation as an indented outline in one call. (Server v0.6.4, running on rss.chat and demo.rss.chat now.)

**These worknotes are a feed now.** Subscribe to [https://news.rss.chat/worknotes/rss.xml](https://news.rss.chat/worknotes/rss.xml) and every improvement to rss.chat arrives as it ships -- the worknotes from the server and the client, together in one feed, newest first. Each item carries a category element saying which side it came from, so a reader that filters by category can follow just one. The feed announces updates over rssCloud, so subscribers who speak it hear within seconds. And in the spirit of a product built on RSS: the feed is generated by a script you can read, published right next to the feed itself -- [worknotesFeed.belt](https://news.rss.chat/worknotes/worknotesFeed.belt). If you run an rss.chat server, this feed is the way to hear about updates like the security fix of 7/23 the moment they're posted. You're reading the first item that was born in the feed.

#### 7/23/26; 10:06 AM ET by CC

**A security fix -- posts are now cleaned as they're saved -- and the first update note of a new kind: how to bring a server you already run up to date.** A post's text is written by its author and then shown to everyone who reads the timeline, which means anything hidden inside it runs in every reader's browser. Until today the server stored a post's text exactly as it arrived, so a post could carry markup that did more than format words. As of server v0.6.3, every post passes through a cleaner on its way into the database. Ordinary writing comes through untouched -- links, bold and italic, quotes, lists, and pasted images are all kept -- but anything that could run code is removed before the post is ever stored. Because the cleaning happens as the post is written, it protects every reader of every feed and timeline at once, and no old or unusual browser can slip past it. Both public servers, rss.chat and demo.rss.chat, are already running it. Thanks to the reader who reported this privately.

**Updating a server you already run.** This is the first of a kind of note you'll see here from now on: when a change matters to people running their own installs, the steps to update will live right here in worknotes. For this one:

1. Get the new `rssnetwork.js` and `package.json` from the repo.
2. In your server's folder, run `npm install`. The updated `package.json` adds one package -- the cleaner -- and this brings it in.
3. Restart the server.

That is the whole update. Nothing in your config or your database changes, and the cleaner applies to new and edited posts the moment you restart.

#### 7/22/26; 6:15 PM ET by CC

**Posts can carry images now, and the server stores and serves them itself.** A new endpoint, `/uploadmedia`, accepts an image from a signed-in user -- up to 2MB, sent base64-encoded in the request body with the content type as a parameter -- stores it in a new `media` table in the database, and answers with the address it will be served from: `/media/1`, `/media/2`, and so on, permanent ids just like posts. Request that address and the image comes back byte-for-byte with the right content type. No filenames, no image processing, no separate file storage -- the picture lives in the same database as everything else, which means the same one-file simplicity on SQLite servers, and the same backup story: the export and import verbs carry the media table along (the bytes travel as text inside the JSON), so a migrated server keeps its images with their addresses intact. The table is called media rather than images on purpose -- one binary table can someday hold audio and video too, and the type column already tells them apart. MySQL servers get the table definition in [installMysql.md](../docs/installMysql.md). The upload limit is a config setting, `maxMediaUploadBytes`, 2MB by default. Under the hood, davesql (v0.7.1) learned to write binary values on both engines -- the last piece the feature needed. (Server v0.6.1.)

#### 7/22/26; 11:30 AM ET by CC

**SQLite is now the default, everywhere.** demo.rss.chat migrated this morning -- 58 users, 210 posts, 153 likes, 138 served files, five minutes -- so both public servers now run on one-file databases. davesql 0.7.0, the package carrying the engine, is published on npm. And the repo caught up with the reality: the example config.json ships with `"flUseSqlite": true`, [install.md](../docs/install.md) is now the SQLite install -- no database server, no schema to paste, a Backups section, and the six-step migration for existing MySQL servers -- while the whole MySQL story (config, schema, upgrade notes) moved to its own page, [installMysql.md](../docs/installMysql.md). Dave announced it on [Scripting News](http://scripting.com/). One lesson from the demo migration made it into the doc: if the import stops on a UNIQUE constraint error, the server touched the new empty database before the import ran -- delete the file and re-run.

**The install docs also gained the piece that was missing: email.** Sign-in is a magic link, so a new server can't sign anyone in until it can send mail -- and nothing documented how. New page: [email.md](../docs/email.md) -- the four SMTP settings for sending through a provider you already use, or Amazon SES with a link to Scott Hanson's setup walkthrough. It's a step in the install checklist now, along with a link to [the questions thread](https://github.com/scripting/rss.chat/issues/17) -- if something in the install isn't working or isn't explained, that's where to say so.

**rss.chat itself now runs on SQLite.** This morning's note said an rss.chat server *can* run on SQLite; by this evening the flagship server *does*. Both production servers were upgraded to the new software (v0.6.0) during the afternoon, running on MySQL exactly as before -- proof that the change disturbs nothing for existing installs. Then the migration itself: export the whole database to one JSON file, set `"flUseSqlite": true` in config.json, import, restart. All 752 rows -- 12 users, 361 posts, 217 likes, 162 served files -- came across with their ids intact, so every permalink still works, and the Software versions dialog now reads "SQLite version: v3.49.2." The MySQL database was never written to during the switch, so rolling back would have been one config line -- it wasn't needed. Total elapsed time, including a wrong turn when an unsaved config file sent the import to the wrong engine (it stopped harmlessly on the first duplicate row): about twenty minutes. demo.rss.chat follows tomorrow.

#### 7/21/26; 11:45 AM ET by CC

**An rss.chat server can now run on SQLite -- no MySQL, no database setup of any kind.** One new member in config.json chooses the engine: `"database": {"flUseSqlite": true, "databaseFilePath": "data/myserver.db"}`. The database is a single file that creates itself, tables and all, the first time the server runs -- the install becomes download, npm install, run. Everything else is identical: same features, same feeds, same API, and a server that says nothing stays on MySQL exactly as before. The engine itself went into davesql (v0.7.0), where all the SQL expertise lives, so the same switch is available to every app built on it. The first server running this way is live at scratchpad.rss.chat -- sign-up, posting, replies, likes, and feeds, all served out of one file on a fresh droplet that has never heard of MySQL.

**And every server now has a backup story: export and import.** `node rssnetwork.js export backup.json` writes the whole database -- users, posts, likes, feeds -- into one JSON file and exits without starting the web server; `node rssnetwork.js import backup.json` loads that file into an empty server. Both work on either engine, which makes the pair the door between them: export from a MySQL server, import into a SQLite one, and the server's whole history comes along -- posts keep their ids, so every permalink survives. The Software versions dialog now names the engine too, so a glance tells you what a server is running on.

#### 7/20/26; 5:45 PM ET by CC

**Three small courtesies for writers, all shipped today.** Posts no longer carry blank lines at the end -- if your post trails off with empty paragraphs or stray Returns, the server trims them when it saves, so nothing renders as mysterious empty space below your last line (a new config setting, `flRemoveBlanksAtEnd`, is on by default; set it false to keep trailing blanks). The autolinker learned that `install.md` is a document's name, not a web address -- bare names ending in a file extension that happens to be a real internet domain ending (.md, .zip, .sh, .py) stay plain text, while real addresses, including bare domains like rss.chat, still become links. And the server's subscription list can now carry a title of your choosing: set `titleForSublist` in config.json; leave it out and the title is unchanged.

#### 7/20/26; 1:45 AM ET by CC

**WordPress joined the cross-post checkboxes.** The composer's row of *also post to* checkboxes can now include a WordPress site: a `crossPostTargets` entry with `"type": "wordpress"` and the site's id. Check the box the first time and the page walks you through the ordinary WordPress.com sign-on (via wpIdentity, the same machinery as the wordpress examples and WordLand) -- after that, publishing a post here also publishes it there, in one motion, straight from the browser. The mirrored post updates in place on later publishes, same as the rss.chat targets; the browser keeps the id map. An AsciiDoc post crosses as its rendered HTML, so it lands on WordPress with its syntax highlighting -- verified earlier tonight through the firehose bridge, now a one-checkbox affair. This grew out of running [inboundRss](../../examples/wordpress/inboundRss/) against this server: that app mirrors a whole feed while a page listens; the checkbox mirrors the post you're publishing right now. Different tools, same open doors. Setting documented in [config.md](../docs/config.md).

#### 7/20/26; 12:30 AM ET by CC

**On the air: the server is a repeater now.** Amateur radio solved coverage-without-a-center decades ago: a club puts a repeater on a hill, it re-transmits what it hears, coverage emerges from overlapping volunteers, and linking repeaters carries a conversation from valley to valley. This server now works the same way. A server that interleaves outside feeds already *hears* them; as of tonight it *re-transmits*: [`/river.xml`](../docs/api.md) is everything it carries -- its own posts and every feed it repeats -- merged, date-sorted, and attributed, as one plain RSS feed (`/river?format=json` for the JSON rendering). Every item names its original feed in its `<source>` element: the station ID. And [`/data/coverage.opml`](../docs/api.md) is the coverage map -- the subscription list of what this repeater carries, which is what you'd read before linking to it.

Linking is the point: another instance adds one `extraFeeds` entry pointing at a repeater's river and inherits its whole coverage, transitively. Dedup-by-guid means linked repeaters don't echo. No load-bearing center, no one to fund but your own $5 box -- if a repeater goes dark, coverage degrades instead of the network dying. The home page announces the river with a second feed-autodiscovery link. Documented in [api.md](../docs/api.md).

#### 7/19/26; 9:30 PM ET by CC

**Four more feeds, and the timeline goes deep.** The interleave grew: Scripting News (Dave's blog -- the network follows its author), and a News group with Hacker News, Ars Technica, and The Verge, alongside the existing rss.chat and Wired groups. And the timeline now loads *everything the server's cache holds* -- `maxRecentItems` raised to 500, the per-feed cache doubled to 50 -- instead of stopping at the first hundred, so you can scroll all the way back to the horizon of what the feeds remember. That horizon is the honest limit of a feed-backed timeline: a feed only publishes its recent entries, so the pool is bounded and one deep fetch is the whole scrollback. True infinite scroll -- an accumulating archive that pages from the database -- would mean persisting interleaved items instead of caching them in memory; that's the natural next step if the appetite holds. Group headings that have a home page now link to it (rss.chat, wired.com), and cross-posting moved onto each post's three-dot menu, so mirroring a post no longer involves hunting for its id.

#### 7/19/26; 7:00 PM ET by CC

**Write once, publish to two networks.** The composer can now cross-post: a new config setting, `crossPostTargets`, names other rss.chat servers, and each gets a checkbox in `/compose` -- check *also demo.rss.chat*, hit Publish, and the post goes up here and there in one motion, with both permalinks in the status bar. The browser remembers which post over there mirrors which post here, so updating a mirrored post updates it on both servers -- and the first cross-post of an already-published post simply creates it over there. It works because both ends run the same software: the browser fires the same `/newpost` at the other server (CORS is already open), with the writer's own account there -- credentials asked for once, kept in the writer's browser, never on this server. The satisfying detail: an AsciiDoc post arrives on the other server as rendered HTML, so the syntax highlighting shows up there too, full color, on a server that has no idea AsciiDoc was involved -- the colors travel inside the HTML, which was the design all along. The rail also regrouped: rss.chat is a heading now with *root* and *demo* under it, since demo.rss.chat joined the interleaved feeds. And clicking a foreign author's name goes to their profile on their own site, addressed by their remote handle (dave@rss.chat).

#### 7/19/26; 5:15 AM ET by CC

**The feed mix moved into the left rail, and every post names its source.** The checkboxes for the interleaved feeds now live where you can always see them: the icon column beside the timeline -- one per outside feed, plus one for this server's own posts, so you can read *only* Wired, or *only* rss.chat, or any mix (they're on the navbar Feeds menu too; same state, wired by the same bridge). A new pen-nib icon, *New AsciiDoc*, sits next to *New post* and opens the composer. And each post's header now says where the post came from, right after the feed icon: the feed's name for interleaved posts, and for local posts the new `localSourceLabel` setting -- on perstitio.us, that's **su.perstitio.us**, because the domain was always one subdomain away from being superstitious. Labels ride a MutationObserver keyed off the feed icon's address, so they appear on posts arriving live over the socket too. Setting documented in [config.md](../docs/config.md).

#### 7/19/26; 4:00 AM ET by CC

**Outside feeds now flow into the timeline -- small pieces, loosely joined, for real.** A new config setting, `extraFeeds`, names outside feeds -- on perstitio.us: rss.chat's everyone-feed, plus three Wired feeds -- and the server does the rest: polls them every five minutes ([extrafeeds.js](extrafeeds.js)), converts entries into the same item records everything else speaks, sanitizes their HTML with the same rules AsciiDoc output gets, merges them date-sorted into `/getrecentitems`, and broadcasts newly-discovered items over the websocket -- so a post on rss.chat, or a Wired story, appears in an open timeline live, exactly like a local post. Nothing is written to the database; the cache is memory and rebuilds on restart.

The client side rides the same bridge as yesterday's compose work: the served home page grows a **Feeds menu with a checkbox per feed** (state per browser), and the bridge filters both the timeline and the socket by them -- uncheck Wired and it's gone, recheck and it's back. Foreign items are marked `flExtra`, and actions on them route home: reply or like a rss.chat post and you land on rss.chat, where those actions are real; same for a Wired story. The same story arriving through two feeds (Wired runs stories in multiple channels) appears once. This finishes the thought the code already had -- `getExtrasList` and the client's disabled `isFeedInExtras` were waiting for exactly this. Setting documented in [config.md](../docs/config.md).

#### 7/19/26; 2:30 AM ET by CC

**The composer has a front door now, and editing an AsciiDoc post goes there.** Two problems, one mechanism. First, `/compose` existed but nothing pointed at it. Second, clicking the pencil on an AsciiDoc post opened the regular editor -- which, per yesterday's fidelity rule, would turn it into a plain HTML post; the only right way to edit an AsciiDoc post is through its source. The mechanism: the server now serves the home page from the repo's own copy of the client's `index.html` (filling the same `[%macros%]`), which lets it add two things at serve time -- a *Compose in AsciiDoc* item on the Menu, and a small injected script, [composebridge.js](composebridge.js), that reroutes the pencil icon and the Edit menu command to `/compose?id=N` when the post carries AsciiDoc source. Posts without source behave exactly as shipped, and all the client's JS still loads from its usual addresses -- only the HTML shell is served locally. The additions are injected as string edits at serve time, so the repo's `index.html` stays identical to upstream and merges stay clean; if an anchor drifts, the injection quietly does nothing and the page behaves as shipped. `/compose?id=N` loads the post's stored source, ready to edit.

#### 7/19/26; 1:15 AM ET by CC

**A composer for AsciiDoc posts, at `/compose`.** The server now serves a writing page -- source pane on the left, live preview on the right, in the split-pane style anyone who writes AsciiDoc in an IDE already knows. The preview isn't an approximation: a new authenticated endpoint, [`/renderasciidoc`](../docs/api.md), runs the exact pipeline a post goes through -- Asciidoctor, syntax highlighting, sanitizing -- so what you see is what the timeline and the feed will get, colors and all. The page is served by the app itself, so it shares the timeline's sign-in: if you're signed in at the home page, `/compose` already knows who you are. Publish posts, load your own AsciiDoc posts by id to edit them, Ctrl/Cmd+Enter to send. No changes to the shipped client -- this is a separate door into the same API, and when the client someday grows a native AsciiDoc editor mode, this page's approach (edit the stored source, never round-trip the rendered HTML) is the model.

**And a fidelity rule for edits.** Editing is where mixed formats can lie: if someone edits an AsciiDoc post with the regular editor, the server gets new HTML and no source -- and the stored `asciidoctext` would silently go stale, waiting to resurrect old content on the next AsciiDoc edit. Now an update that carries `description` without `asciidoctext` clears the stored source: the post has ceased to be an AsciiDoc post, and the record says so. Documented in [api.md](../docs/api.md).

#### 7/18/26; 11:45 PM ET by CC

**Highlighted code now keeps its colors in the timeline.** The first AsciiDoc posts had a puzzle: open one in the editor and the code was in full color, but the same post in the timeline was black and white. The data was fine -- the styles were right there in the stored HTML. The thief was the classic theme, on purpose: displayed posts are protected by a flatten-everything rule, `.divChat .divTweetText * { color: inherit !important }`, so foreign HTML arriving from feeds can't paint the timeline. A stylesheet `!important` outranks a plain inline style -- and the composer isn't covered by the rule, which is why the editor showed color. The CSS cascade leaves exactly one lever that outranks a stylesheet `!important`: an inline style that is itself `!important`. Since the server generates the highlighting, it now emits every declaration that way -- `color:#D73A49 !important` -- scoped to the code blocks only. The cleaner fix is a one-line exemption for highlighted code in the theme itself; until the theme grows one, this works everywhere, feeds included. The already-published posts were re-rendered by re-saving each one through `/updatepost` with its stored source -- no HTML surgery, which is the point of keeping the source.

#### 7/18/26; 8:30 PM ET by CC

**Posts can now be written in AsciiDoc, with syntax-highlighted code.** Send `asciidoctext` in the `/newpost` or `/updatepost` jsontext and the server renders it: structure via Asciidoctor, code blocks highlighted by Shiki, the result sanitized and stored as `description` -- so the existing client and every feed reader display it with no changes on their end. The raw source is preserved in a new `asciidoctext` column on items (the parallel of `markdowntext`), so a post can be re-edited as AsciiDoc; it also rides along in the item record the API returns. The markdown and HTML paths are untouched -- this is a third way to write a post, not a replacement.

Two choices worth explaining. The highlighting uses *inline* styles -- `<span style="color:...">` -- instead of the classes highlight.js or Prism emit, because posts here are RSS items that travel to feed readers that have never heard of our stylesheets; inline colors render everywhere. And the output is sanitized *because it has to be*: Asciidoctor's passthrough syntax (`+++...+++`) emits raw HTML -- including a live `<script>` -- even in secure mode, so the rendered HTML goes through sanitize-html, which keeps the highlighting and the tables and drops scripts, event handlers, and `javascript:` links. Both AsciiDoc's native `[source,lang]` blocks and markdown-style backtick fences highlight, about two dozen languages at launch. The schema change is in [install.md](../docs/install.md) (fresh install and upgrade), the API shape in [api.md](../docs/api.md). Live on perstitio.us; there's no authoring UI in the client yet, so AsciiDoc posts arrive through the API -- which is an open door on purpose.

**The `/feed` endpoint can now return the feed as JSON.** As of server v0.5.32, `/feed` takes a `format` parameter: [format=xml](https://rss.chat/feed?screenname=dave) (the default) returns the RSS document as always, and [format=json](https://rss.chat/feed?screenname=dave&format=json) returns the same feed translated into JSON. The structure is `rss.channel.item`, the names are RSS 2.0's own names, every element -- `source:markdown`, `source:inReplyTo`, `source:comments`, all of it -- exactly where the XML puts it. An unsupported format name gets an error naming the two real ones.

#### 7/18/26; 12:45 PM ET by CC

**threadwalker caught up with yesterday's feed change.** Ricardo reported on [issue #14](https://github.com/scripting/rss.chat/issues/14) that the walker printed `?` for every author -- it was still reading the item-level `source:account` element that came out of the feeds yesterday. Now it reads what the feeds actually say: replies carry a core RSS `<source>` element naming the author, and in a user's own feed the channel says whose feed it is. Also fixed while in there: the walker's starting feed still pointed at the old `users.rss.network` address, which now answers with a redirect that Node's bare `https.get` won't follow -- it points at `https://rss.chat/users/manton/rss.xml` directly. Verified against the live thread: the whole conversation prints, every author named. A few doc examples still showing old feed addresses were updated to match.

#### 7/18/26; 11:30 AM ET by CC

**The firehose is now documented, with two working demo apps.** Every rss.chat server broadcasts every new post, edit, and like over a websocket the moment it happens -- the same stream the shipped client uses to keep timelines current. As of today there's a doc that tells you how to drink from it -- [firehose.md](../docs/firehose.md): the address, the wire format, the two verbs, and the three things a well-behaved listener does -- and two demo apps in [examples/firehose](../../examples/firehose/) that prove it: a Node command-line app that logs each post as it arrives, and a browser page that shows the JSON flowing through. Each is about a page of code, adapted from the [feedlandSocket](https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSocket) demos -- it's the same protocol FeedLand uses, so a listener written for one can listen to the other. No account, no key: connect and the posts come to you.

#### 7/17/26; 4:05 PM ET by CC

**`source:account` moved to where the spec says it goes.** Our feeds had been putting a `source:account` element inside every item. The [source namespace](https://source.scripting.com/) defines it as a channel-level element — it says whose feed this is, not who wrote an item — and at the item level it was redundant anyway: in the mixed feeds, every item already carries a `<source>` element with the author's feed URL and name. As of today, each user's own feed says it once, in the channel: `<source:account service="rss.chat">dave</source:account>`. The items carry it no more. The everyone feed and the comments feeds have no channel account — they have many authors, and their items keep `<source>` for per-item attribution. If you've been reading the item-level element, read the channel-level one (single-author feeds) or `<source>` (mixed feeds) instead. Already-published feeds keep the old shape until they next rebuild. The report that got this fixed is [issue #9](https://github.com/scripting/rss.chat/issues/9). The channel-level support went into [daverss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/daverss), the shared RSS-building package, as a new optional setting.

#### 7/17/26; 10:15 AM ET by CC

**The home page now announces its own feed.** Every server's home page carries a feed auto-discovery link — the standard `<link rel="alternate">` in the page head, pointing at that server's everyone feed. Point a feed reader at the home page of rss.chat, or demo.rss.chat, or your own install, and it finds the feed by itself, no hunting for the URL. The address is filled in per-instance by a new home-page macro, `[%feedUrlEveryone%]`, so the same template serves every server correctly. Work by DW.

#### 7/16/26; 6:00 PM ET by CC

**The install doc learned from two real installs today.** Scott Hanson tested the new database-mode instructions by having an AI agent do a fresh install on a throwaway server — it worked, and the one thing it had to hunt for became [issue #8](https://github.com/scripting/rss.chat/issues/8): the doc never said what port to point a reverse proxy at. Fixed the same hour: step 8 of [install.md](../docs/install.md) now says the server listens on port 1420 (configurable via `port` in config.json or the PORT environment variable) and websockets have their own port, 1422 (`websocketPort`). Separately, for anyone upgrading an existing S3 server to database mode, the upgrade section gained the step we ourselves missed: a one-line SQL update that rewrites the old feed addresses stored with each post — without it, every rebuilt feed comes up empty. If you run a server from before today, that section is worth a read.

#### 7/15/26; 5:15 PM ET by CC

**The biggest install hurdle is gone. Feeds can now live in the database, served by the server itself — no S3, no AWS account.** A new config setting, `flFeedsInDatabase`, turns it on. When it's true, the server stores its RSS feeds and its subscription list in a new `files` table and serves them from its own domain — your feed is at `https://yourserver/users/yourname/rss.xml`, the subscription list at `https://yourserver/data/subs.opml`, and the four feed-location settings from Monday's note aren't needed at all. When it's false (the built-in default), nothing changes — S3 publishing works exactly as before.

Turning it on for an existing server is one restart: at startup the server backfills — rebuilds every user's feed, every comments feed, and the everyone feed from the database, so the files are all there before the first request. Both of our servers, rss.chat and demo.rss.chat, made the switch today.

One thing the flag can't do for you: subscribers still point at your old S3 addresses. The fix is a redirect where the old feed domain is served. Ours is one rule in the Caddyfile — every request to the old domain answers with a permanent redirect to the same path under rss.chat — and well-behaved feed readers update their stored addresses when they see a 301. Details in [install.md](../docs/install.md), which now describes the database-mode install; S3 remains documented in [config.md](../docs/config.md) for those who want it.

#### 7/14/26; 9:45 AM ET by CC

**Server v0.5.27. The feed-location settings have no built-in defaults anymore.** Yesterday's note told how a new server that didn't set its own S3 locations inherited defaults pointing at rss.chat's folders. As of this version those defaults are gone: `rssS3Path`, `rssFeedUrl`, `opmlS3Path`, and `opmlListUrl` start as undefined, and your config.json supplies the real values — see [Feeds on S3](../docs/config.md#feeds-on-s3) in config.md. rss.chat's own config now sets its four values explicitly, the same as every other install. (`rssFilename` keeps its default, `rss.xml` — that one is right for every server.)

A detail that made this easy to verify: the server rebuilds its subscription list, subs.opml, on startup. Restart with the new settings and the file appears at its new address right away — no waiting for a post to trigger a rebuild.

#### 7/13/26; 7:20 PM ET by CC

**There's a second server now — demo.rss.chat — and standing it up taught the docs some things.** Dave installed it on a different machine, following [install.md](../docs/install.md) for real, start to finish. It's open — no whitelist, anyone can join. Two lessons from the exercise, both now in the docs:

First, every server needs its own S3 locations for feeds. The install initially inherited the defaults, which point at rss.chat's own folders — so the new server was overwriting the original's feeds. config.md now has a [Feeds on S3](../docs/config.md#feeds-on-s3) section covering the four settings, and they're in the example config.json so they're on every installer's list.

Second, websockets need a route in your reverse proxy. Live updates run over a websocket on their own port (`websocketPort`), and the proxy in front of the server has to send upgrade requests there — with Caddy, that's a matcher on your domain plus the Connection/Upgrade headers, proxying to that port. And if more than one of these apps runs behind the same proxy, each needs its own port. Until the route existed, the site worked fine and only live updates were missing — if new posts don't appear without a reload, this is the first place to look.

Also new today: server v0.5.26 adds `blockedUsersList` to config.json — an array of email addresses that can't sign up, sign in, or post. It's checked fresh from the file on every use, so adding an address takes effect immediately, no restart. Case doesn't matter.

#### 7/13/26; 9:30 AM ET by CC

**Server v0.5.25. Bare URLs become links, automatically, when a post saves.** Type or paste a web address into a post and it's clickable when it publishes — no more selecting the text and reaching for the link button. The idea came from a user, [Don Park](https://rss.chat/?id=248), the day before it shipped.

The work happens on the server, in `newPost` and `updatePost`, so every client gets it for free. The post's text passes through the [Autolinker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autolinker) package on its way to the database — it understands HTML, so it only touches plain text: a URL that's already part of a link, or sitting inside an image tag, is left alone, and the link text is exactly what the writer typed. The stored markdown is untouched — the source stays as written; only the rendered text gets the links.

#### 7/12/26; 11:55 PM ET by CC

**The API has a doc now.** [api.md](../docs/api.md), new in server/docs, documents the HTTP interface between the rss.chat client and its server — every read and write call, the no-passwords email flow, the item record field by field, and the websocket verbs. The client that ships with the product is just one user of this API; the doc is for whoever wants to build the next one.

Also in server/docs: install.md's "An AI can do this install" section moved to the end of the doc — it's a good trick, but not the first thing a new host-runner needs to read.

#### 7/12/26; 11:50 AM ET by CC

**A deleted post can't crash its own comments feed anymore.** There was a sequence that could bring down a feed rebuild: someone replies to a post, the author deletes the post, then the reply gets edited. Rebuilding the comments feed found the parent gone — deleted posts are filtered out of every query — and crashed trying to read it. Now the build answers the way this server always answers: "Can't build the comments feed for post N because the post has been deleted."

Also: this file moved from server/docs to server/code. Worknotes live with the code, because you need the worknotes to read the code.

#### 7/11/26; 7:45 PM ET by CC

**Sign-up and sign-in emails were going to spam. Fixed — no code change.** The cause: `mailSender` was a gmail.com address, but the mail actually goes out through Amazon SES, and Gmail sends mail to spam when the sending server isn't authorized to send for the address's domain — as policy, since 2024. The fix, useful to anyone deploying this server: verify your domain as an identity in the SES console (it hands you three DKIM CNAME records to add to your DNS), then set `mailSender` in config.json to an address on that domain. It doesn't need a real mailbox behind it — rss.chat now sends as hello@rss.chat. Verification took minutes, and the first email after the change landed in the inbox.

#### 7/11/26; 12:50 PM ET by CC

The server moved into the [rss.chat repo](https://github.com/scripting/rss.chat). One repo for the whole product now, organized by part: the server's code is at server/code, and these docs — install, config, and this file — are at server/docs. The software is unchanged; only the address is new.

#### 7/9/26; 6:16 PM by CC

`/getiteminfo` joined `/getitembyguid` in robots.txt's Disallow list — both calls serve individual posts on demand, and we'd rather aggressive crawlers not treat them as an invitation to walk the whole database one post at a time. Feeds remain the front door, and they're static files on S3.

#### 7/9/26; 1:10 PM by CC

Server v0.5.23. There's a new call, `/getiteminfo` — it answers the question a feed can't: what's at the other end of a `source:inReplyTo` link. Give it the address of any post and it returns the post as JSON.

```
curl "https://rss.chat/getiteminfo?guid=https://rss.chat/?id=204"
```

You can pass `id=204` instead of the guid if you have the post number. There are two formats, chosen with the `format` param:

* `rss`, the default — the item in feed vocabulary: description, guid, account, inReplyTo, comments and source, the same names and structures you see in our feeds. If you can read the feeds, you already know how to read this.
* `feedland` — the internal record, the same structure our firehose broadcasts, compatible with FeedLand. Flatter, with ids and counts you can use directly.

Asking for a format that doesn't exist gets an error saying so, and asking for a deleted post gets the standard *Can't view the post because it has been deleted.* — errors are always an object with a `message` property.

There's also a new place to start reading about all of this: [RSS as a social network](https://source.scripting.com/social.opml), a walkthrough that tells the story of one real conversation — a post, its replies, and the feeds that connect them — one element at a time.

#### 7/8/26; 10:50 AM by CC

Server v0.5.21. Comments feeds are live — the feature previewed in the last entry shipped today, and its first real thread was Manton Reece saying hello.

Here's how it works. Any post that has replies now carries a new element in its feed item:

```xml
<source:comments count="1" feedUrl="https://users.rss.network/manton/comments/204.xml"/>
```

The `count` says how many direct replies the post has; the `feedUrl` points at a small RSS feed containing them. That comments feed is a static file on S3, published alongside the user feeds, and its items are ordinary items — description, pubDate, guid, `source:markdown`, `source:inReplyTo` pointing back up at the parent. When a reply has replies of its own, its item carries its own `source:comments`, so an entire conversation is traversable from the feeds alone, one level at a time, every level the same shape.

Because a comments feed mixes authors, each of its items also carries RSS core's `<source>` element for attribution:

```xml
<source url="https://users.rss.network/dave/rss.xml">Dave Winer</source>
```

— the author's display name and the address of their home feed. The everyone feed, which mixes authors the same way, now carries `<source>` on its items too.

The feeds rebuild automatically: adding, editing, or deleting a reply republishes the parent post's comments feed, and also the parent author's own feed, since the count on their post just changed. Live example, the first thread: [manton's feed](https://users.rss.network/manton/rss.xml) → [the comments feed for post 204](https://users.rss.network/manton/comments/204.xml).

Later the same day, two finishing touches. A backfill published comments feeds for all 74 existing conversations, so every feedUrl the feeds advertise now resolves — including the threads that predate the feature. And a subtle case is covered: when you reply to a reply, the middle post's comment count now updates in its parent's comments feed too, so a program walking the tree never hits a level that doesn't know about the one below it. (That one was found by writing a demo app against the feeds — the tree is now walkable all the way down, and we've done it.) `source:comments` is documented in the [source namespace](https://source.scripting.com/).

#### 7/7/26; 1:55 PM by CC

Server v0.5.19. Deleted posts are no longer served. Requesting a deleted post by its permalink now returns an error object with a plain-English message — *Can't view the post because it has been deleted.* — instead of the post's content. If you're building on the API, this is the shape all our errors take: an object with a `message` property.

Server v0.5.20. Every feed the server generates now carries `<source:self>` — the feed's own address, so a feed that's been copied or re-served can always say where it canonically lives. It's part of the [source namespace](https://source.scripting.com/).

Coming next: comments feeds. Any post with replies will point, from its item in the feed, to a small RSS feed containing those replies — and replies with replies point onward the same way, so a whole conversation will be traversable from the feeds alone. The design is settled; the code is next.

#### 7/5/26 by CC

In the RSS feeds the server generates, a reply's `<source:inReplyTo>` element now carries the parent post's actual permalink, for example `https://rss.chat/?id=163`. Follow the link and you're looking at the post being replied to. Before this, the element pointed at a `/parent` URL that was never implemented, so the link led nowhere. If you're building on the feeds, this means reply threads are now traversable from the feed alone. (Server v0.5.18.)

In myAboutDialog we were referencing the version for daveAppserver, changed it so it's now referring to the correct version for rssnetwork.js. 

#### 6/20/26; 11:06:05 AM by DW

Changed how permalinks work. 

We no longer store a guid value in the database, instead we compute it when we need it.

The format of the url changed to: https://rss.network/?idstory=1402

Commented all the feedland links, we no longer depend on a feedland running behind our server.

#### 6/18/26; 11:13:06 AM by DW

Commented implementation of signupDialog here, and will include the version in FeedLand Home. So that's the official version. 

#### 6/4/26; 10:37:09 AM by DW -- v0.4.16. 

Fixed various high errors reported by Claude.

#### 6/3/26; 5:09:28 PM by DW

Flattened rssHeadElements in config. If we leave it as a structure, then a config.json file has to change all the values to change on. 

#### 5/16/26; 1:22:02 PM by DW

Added default font and fontsize in body element in styles.css.

Added the skeleton of the prefs user interface, we don't have a way to store them in the database. 

There's a new menu in the right side of the menu, to support logging in and out, and settings. 

Included Ubuntu font. I like it and use it as my default font everywhere.

smoothing out connection between feedland and rssnetwork



suppose i have a feedurl, how do i determine if it's one of our feeds, i only want to see log messages if it's one of ours

all log messages that stay must have timestamp. 

#### 5/10/26; 12:51:59 PM by Claude

In addEmailToUserInDatabase, we can't generate a new emailSecret each time a user confirms a magic link, because email-link scanners (Gmail and others) pre-fetch the URL before the user clicks it. The pre-fetch and the click each call this function, each generates its own secret, and the database ends up with one while the user's browser ends up with the other -- so every post afterwards fails authentication. We mint a secret only on first-time user creation; existing users get back the secret that's already stored. Feedland landed on the same posture in 2022 for the closely-related multi-device version of this problem.

#### 5/3/26; 11:50:21 AM by DW

Added markdowntext support.

#### 5/2/26; 6:17:52 PM by DW

Added inReplyTo to the items table. 

#### 4/29/26; 10:47:40 AM by DW

New database call -- getRecentItems. Interfaces through the rest interface. 

Editing in client/chat.css and chat.js

* removed all blank lines from chat.css, the code was written by claude as if you'd be reading it in a flat text editor. in an outliner the blank lines are an intrusion. now it's okay to put blank lines in css files, i do it to separate sections from each other. lots of prior art for this. 

* in chatUserInterface, the first declaration should be the container of everything. i had to fumble around to find it (was divPhone). It should always be at the very top.

* in the css code, the names should be defined not standalone, for example, don't define .divHead, define .divChat .divHead. we get in trouble very quickly with naked names like divHead which is pretty common. your css starts interfering with each other. i'm still dealing with code written a long time ago that doesn't make css defs specific enough so as not to interfere. 

#### 4/28/26; 9:44:57 AM by DW

Made it so build script only copies files that haven't changed, should improve performance because writing to Claude is on a remote server and is relatively expensive.

appConsts.flPostItemsLocally, up till now when you enter an item interactively we immediately post it to the timeline. 

i added an option to turn this off because i want the items to show up in the timeline after a roundtrip through the feed, rssCloud, feedLand and the sockets and into the timeline. 

in other words, you get it at the same instant all the other users get it.

There's some remaining stuff from the factoring of rssNetworkServer.

#### 4/18/26; 11:31:33 AM by DW

These were docs included in the code, they belong here in worknotes. 

Each user is stored as data/{screenname}.json:

Getting info from config.json to the code running in the client app. 

When daveappserver returns the home page for the site, it also does a string replace for macros. 

The values of the macros can be anything chosen from config. So it can be told for example what the URL of the server was that launched it. It doesn't need to be hard-coded into the client app.
